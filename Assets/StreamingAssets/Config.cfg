// All fields, that are a part of Config class must be set first
// IsInvinsible true

/*
	If you have this layout in Config.cs:

struct Volume {
	public int Sound;
	public float Music;
	public float Voice
}

public static class Config {
	public static float  Speed;
	public static Volume VolumeData;
...

    And this layout in Config.cfg

[Volume]
Sound       8
Music       10.0
Voice       10.0

Speed 22.3

    VolumeData will be set, but Speed won't. So set all the Config.cs field before categories.
